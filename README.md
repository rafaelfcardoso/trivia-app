# Trivia App
This Trivia is a mobile first web app that offers the following features:
  - Log into the game and, if the email is registered on the [Gravatar] website (https://pt.gravatar.com/), have your photo associated with the user's profile.
    - Access a page related to the game, where you must choose one of the available answers for each question of the questions. The answer must be checked before the timer reaches zero, otherwise the answer must be considered wrong.
    - Be redirected, after 5 questions answered, to the score screen, where the text depends on the number of hits.
    - Display a ranking page, if you like, at the end of each game.
    - Configure some options for the game in a configuration screen accessible from the application header.
